Thanks to Collin McAllister's submission on 7/13/1999, I liked his interface
for a simple user input/selection!!

I have added a couple of things, you can have up to 10 criteria selections
when querying a single table (I have not tested this on multiple tables).

I have also added simple joins for up to 3 tables, I have played with the
criteria on a limited basis when doing the joins, but I hope someone will
find this interesting if not useful in some way.

You have to select a database first (Access 97, Jet 3.51 version).
Select a table by dragging the table name to the Selected listbox or
to select up to 3 tables, click the multiple checkbox before dragging
the table name and drag as many table names as indicated with the
inputbox (up to 3)

If you selected more than one table, a dialog with appear to perform
the join in a visual manner.  Choose the two tables (if you have more than 2)
and select the field in each listbox to join, click the "Add Join" button.

Once you are back to the Query form, click on the selected tables to 
populate the field listbox.  Drag the desired fields to the next listbox
and they will appear n the criteria listbox.

Doubleclick the items in the criteria listbox to add conditions to the query.

I know this is rough, but it might be OK for a limited use such as mine.
